        "Pour the sugar into a 1 quart jar. Fill the remaining space with berries, but do not pack down. Fill the jar with vodka so that the berries are completely covered. Seal the jar. Let the jar stand for 2 months, shaking the jar every week. The sugar should dissolve, and the vodka will become colored.",
