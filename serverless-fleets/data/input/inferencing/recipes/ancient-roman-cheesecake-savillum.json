        "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Pour some water into a small, oven proof bowl, and place into the oven. Arrange the bay leaves over the bottom of the springform pan to cover.",
        "Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl, then mix in ricotta cheese, honey, orange zest, and lemon juice.  Sprinkle in the flour, and stir until evenly combined. Gently pour the batter over the bay leaves, being careful not to disturb them too much.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 35 to 40 minutes. Run the tip of a paring knife around the edges of the pan, and release from the springform pan. Invert onto a serving plate, and serve warm or chilled."
