        "Mix soy sauce, green onion, hoisin sauce, vegetable oil, white wine, cornstarch, sugar, ginger, garlic, five-spice powder, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Stir chicken cubes into the sauce to coat; marinate in refrigerator for 2 hours.",
        "Place 1 to 2 chicken cubes onto a square of aluminum foil and fold the foil diagonally to make a triangle. Fold the edges over tightly several times, about 1/4 inch per fold, squeezing as much air as possible out of the packet. Repeat with remaining ingredients and foil.",
        "Pour 1 cup peanut oil, or as needed, into a heavy skillet (such as a cast-iron pan) to a depth of 1/2 inch; heat over medium heat until oil is shimmering.",
        "Gently lay the chicken packets, working in batches if necessary, into the hot oil and cook until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear (open a test packet to be sure), about 5 minutes per side. Drain packets on paper towels. Serve chicken in foil wrappers and let diners unwrap their own."
