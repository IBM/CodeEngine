        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Thoroughly grease a 10 x 4 inch tube pan.",
        "Mix sugar and cinnamon.  Cut biscuits in quarters, then roll each piece in sugar-cinnamon mixture.  Arrange about 1/4 of the biscuit pieces and blueberries in an even layer in pan.",
        "Place blueberries between biscuit pieces, creating a mosaic effect.  Repeat three times with remaining biscuits and blueberries, covering blueberries of one layer with biscuits in next layer to avoid a column of blueberries.",
        "In saucepan combine sugar, margarine, vanilla, cinnamon, and the additional cup of blueberries.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat.  Cook, stirring frequently until sugar is dissolved and margarine is melted.  Pour over biscuits in pan.",
        "Bake for 65 minutes or until done.  Lift or turn out onto a cake plate."
