        "When you are ready to make the pie, begin by making the pastry.  In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups flour and salt. Cut in the shortening and 2 tablespoons butter until the mixture is the consistency of cornmeal. Make a well in the center of the mixture, and add cold water. Stir together to form a ball.  Let rest 20 minutes.",
        "Roll out dough, and place in pie pan. Spread apple mixture into the pastry lined pan, and dot with 1 tablespoon butter. Cover with top crust, and seal the edges. Cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush half-and-half over the top crust. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar.",
