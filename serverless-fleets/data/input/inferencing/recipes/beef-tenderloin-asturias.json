Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until steaks reach desired doneness, about 6 minutes for medium-rare. Remove steaks from skillet and keep warm.",

Simmer until the wine has reduced by half, then add the beef broth, return to a simmer, and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the crumbled blue cheese until just melted.",
