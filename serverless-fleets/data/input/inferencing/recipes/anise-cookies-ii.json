        "The next day, cover cookies with a sheet of parchment paper, and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes.  Cookies are done when bottom is light brown, but tops are still almost white.  Cool.",
        "Store in container for 2 to 3 weeks in a cool place to mellow and to turn soft.  You can add a slice of bread or a piece of apple to  help soften the cookies."
