Mix coriander, a generous sprinkling of salt and the chutney in a medium bowl, then add chicken breasts (and tenderloins), and toss to coat with sauce. Place chicken, skinned side up, on a wire rack set over a foiled-lined pan; broil without turning until chicken is cooked through and spotty brown, about 8 minutes.",
