        "Preheat oven to 225\u00b0F. and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.",
        "Sift 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar evenly onto lined baking sheets. With a mandoline or other manual slicer cut apples crosswise into paper-thin slices. Arrange apple slices in one layer on sheets and sprinkle evenly with remaining 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar. Bake slices in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, 2 1/4 hours total, or until slices are pale golden and starting to crisp. Immediately peel apple chips off parchment and cool on a rack. Apple chips keep in an airtight container at room temperature 2 weeks. Recommended for garnish on ice creams and apple desserts or as a crisp, cookie-like accompaniment."
