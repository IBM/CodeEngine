        "Whisk together the buttermilk and eggs in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. Stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in the buttermilk mixture and mashed bananas, being careful not to over mix the batter (the batter will be lumpy). Let the batter sit for at least 1 minute before using.",
        "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side."
