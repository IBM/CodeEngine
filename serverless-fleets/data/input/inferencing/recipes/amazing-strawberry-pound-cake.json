        "Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract and ground almonds with the last egg. Pour flour alternately with milk, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in strawberries and water; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared pans.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Run a paring knife between the cake and the edge of the pans and allow cake to cool completely before removing."
