        "Meanwhile, stir the bacon and onion together in a large skillet over medium heat until the fat has rendered from the bacon and the onion is very tender but not brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in the flour, sugar, and salt; cook for 1 minute. Pour in the vinegar; bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.",
        "Pour the dressing over the potatoes and sprinkle with celery seed and parsley. Stir gently to combine. Serve hot."
