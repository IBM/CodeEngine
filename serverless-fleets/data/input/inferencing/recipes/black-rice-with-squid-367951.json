        "If the squid has tentacles, pull them away from the body. Cut the squid into 1-inch strips. Then cut into 1-inch cubes. Pour the fish stock into a saucepan, cover, and bring to a simmer. Put a large pan over high heat and add the oil. Add the squid. Fry for 2 minutes, until golden in places. Add the sofrito and continue to cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Add a teaspoon of water if the sofrito starts to stick to the bottom of the pan. Add the rice, stirring it into the squid. Fry for 10 minutes, stirring often. Turn the heat to high and add a ladle of stock, stirring continuously. Once the stock has been absorbed, add another ladle and repeat until 5 minutes have passed. Dissolve the squid ink in a little of the remaining stock. Add this to the rice, and then continue adding the rest of the stock. Cook the rice for another 12 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the picada and continue to cook for another 2 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and is just tender to the bite. Season with salt, then serve."
