        "Cut pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices and cut slices into 1/2-inch squares. Cut leeks crosswise into thin slices and in a bowl soak in water to cover, separating slices into rings and agitating occasionally to dislodge any grit, 5 minutes. Lift leeks from water and drain in a colander. Trim snow peas and halve diagonally.",
