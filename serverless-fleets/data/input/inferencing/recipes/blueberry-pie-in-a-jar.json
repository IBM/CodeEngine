        "Ladle into 7 sterilized quart jars with lids and rings. Process in a pressure canner for 5 minutes at 5 pounds of pressure.  Remove jars from the canner and place on cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press top of each lid with finger, ensuring that seal is tight (lid doesn't move up or down at all). Sealed jars can be stored for up to a year."
