        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the tater tots in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, so that they are no longer frozen but not completely cooked. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.",
        "Place bacon slices in a skillet over medium heat. Fry bacon until cooked through but still flexible. Drain on paper towels.",
        "Break each slice of cheese into small pieces. Each slice should make about 16 pieces. Place a piece of cheese against the side of a tater tot. Wrap with a piece of the bacon and secure with a toothpick. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat until you run out of tots.",
        "Bake for about 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bacon is crisp."
