        "Now it gets to be fun.  You have to work in all five pounds of flour little by little by hand.  It will work in but it takes a while.  You'll wind up with a BIG mixing bowl of dough.",
        "Refrigerate dough overnight.",
        "Have plenty of people to help with the cooking.  Lightly grease and heat the empty cookie iron over a gas burner.  Start with a tablespoon and a half of dough rolled into a little \"cigar\" shape and vary amount to fit the size of your cookie iron.  It takes from one to one and a half minutes to cook each cookie - it's a trial and error process at first till you get a handle on the temperature of the gas burner and the heat retaining capabilities of your iron.  A properly cooked cookie will be golden and after cooled, crisp.",
        "This a family holiday tradition for us and we spend a whole day cooking cookies with lots of testing to make sure they're as good as last year's.  The cast iron cookie irons work best, but I have seen people make them with the aluminum pizelle \"irons\".  Ask for a krumkokie (croom cockie) iron at a gourmet cooking shop.  We put them in tins and store till next Christmas, eating last year's cookies."
