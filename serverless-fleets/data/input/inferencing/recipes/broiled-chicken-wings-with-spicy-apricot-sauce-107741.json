        "While wings are broiling, blend preserves, lime juice, garlic, cumin, cayenne, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor or blender until smooth. Transfer to a small heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, 1 minute.",
