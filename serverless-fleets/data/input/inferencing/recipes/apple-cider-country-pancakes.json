        "Heat sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it melts into a thick amber-colored liquid, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add apple cider slowly to the saucepan, stirring constantly, until mixture is the consistency of syrup, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cover.",
