        "In a small bowl, mix flour, almonds, 1/2 cup sugar, and cinnamon together.  Add chilled butter and vanilla extract.  Cut together with a pastry blender until small crumbs form.",
        "Unfold pastry and cut into a 10 inch circle.  Place on a large, ungreased baking sheet.  Brush with melted butter or margarine.  Arrange apples in the center of the pastry, leaving a 1/2 inch wide border of pastry.  Spoon almond topping gently over the apples, being careful it doesn't spill over the edges of the pastry.",
        "Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.",
        "Place egg yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.  Beat mixture constantly with a portable electric mixer.  When foamy, add the marsala; continue to beat until the mixture begins to thicken.  Do not overcook, or the mixture will curdle.  Remove from heat. Serve warm over the apple crumble."
