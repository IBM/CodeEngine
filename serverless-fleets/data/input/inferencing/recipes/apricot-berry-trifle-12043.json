Spoon one third or the apricot custard evenly over the red berry layer, top it with half the remaining cake, and sprinkle the cake with half the remaining brandy. Pour the blackberry mixture evenly over the cake, spoon half the remaining custard over it, and top the custard with the remaining cake. Sprinkle the cake with the remaining brandy, pour the remaining red berry mixture evenly over it, and spoon the remaining custard evenly over the red berry layer, covering the red berry layer completely.",
