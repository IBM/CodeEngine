        "After the machine is done, take the dough out, and place it on a very lightly floured board, punch the dough down, and let rest for 5 minutes.",
        "Divide the dough in half.  Then divide into 3 equal pieces, roll into ropes about 12 to 14 inches, and braid into a loaf.  Do the same with the remaining other half.  Gently put the loaves on a greased cookie sheet, mist with water, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let rise for 1  to 1 1/2 hours in a warm, draft free place, until double in size.",
