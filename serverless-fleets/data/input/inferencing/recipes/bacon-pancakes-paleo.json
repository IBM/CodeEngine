        "Beat eggs and banana in a bowl with an electric mixer until foamy and smooth. Beat 1 1/2 tablespoons bacon drippings, crumbled bacon pieces, and vanilla extract into egg mixture. Whisk coconut flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into egg mixture until batter is just combined. Let batter rest for 2 minutes.",
