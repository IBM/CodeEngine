Remove beef with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel. Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil to the drippings remaining in the skillet and heat until near smoking. Cook and stir carrots, bell pepper, mushrooms, broccoli, green onions, garlic, and ginger in the drippings and oil mixture until the vegetables are tender, about 4 minutes.",
