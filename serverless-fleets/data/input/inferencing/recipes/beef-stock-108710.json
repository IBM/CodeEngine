        "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450\u00b0F.",
        "Spread beef shanks, veal shanks, onions, and carrot in a large flameproof roasting pan and roast, turning occasionally, until well browned, about 1 hour.",
        "While shanks roast, wrap parsley, thyme, and bay leaf in cheesecloth and tie with string to make a bouquet garni.",
        "Transfer meat and vegetables to a 6- to 8-quart stockpot. Straddle roasting pan across 2 burners, then add 2 cups water and deglaze pan by boiling over high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Add deglazing liquid to stockpot along with 14 cups water, celery, salt, and bouquet garni. Bring to a boil and skim froth. Add remaining 1/2 cup water, then bring mixture to a simmer and skim froth. Simmer gently, uncovered, 5 hours.",
        "Pour stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing hard on solids, and discard solids. If stock measures more than 8 cups, boil until reduced to 8 cups; add water if stock measures less than 8 cups. If using stock right away, skim off and discard fat. If not, cool stock completely, uncovered, before skimming fat (it will be easier to remove when cool), then chill, covered."
