Add the tomatoes, the garlic, the paprika, and the saffron and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the rice and cook the mixture, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the broth, heated, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 7 minutes. Transfer the rice mixture to a shallow 5-quart baking dish and arrange the chicken over it.",
