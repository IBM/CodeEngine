        "Beat the shortening and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the mixture before adding the next. Beat in the food coloring, 1 teaspoon blueberry extract, and apple cider vinegar with the last egg.  Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing until just incorporated. Pour the batter into prepared pans.",
