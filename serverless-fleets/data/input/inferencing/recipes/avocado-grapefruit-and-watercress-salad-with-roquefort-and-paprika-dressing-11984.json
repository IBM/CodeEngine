        "With a serrated knife cut the zest and pith from the grapefruits and working over a bowl cut the flesh into sections, discarding the membranes and reserving 6 tablespoons of the juice. Peel and pit the avocados and cut them into 12 wedges. In a bowl sprinkle the avocados with 3 tablespoons of the reserved grapefruit juice, coating them thoroughly. In another bowl whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons reserved grapefruit juice, the vinegar, the mustard, the paprika, and salt and pepper to taste, add the oil in a stream, whisking, and whisk the dressing until it is emulsified. In a large bowl toss the watercress with two thirds of the dressing and divide it among 4 salad plates. Top the watercress decoratively with the avocado wedges, drained, and the grapefruit sections, sprinkle the salads with in Roquefort, and drizzle them with the remaining dressing."
