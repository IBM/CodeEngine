        "Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Pour 1/3 cup of batter onto hot skillet and use a spoon to spread the pancake a bit. Cook until browned and bubbles appear on top, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned and set in the middle, about 2 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter."
