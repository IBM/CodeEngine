        "In a bowl, combine onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper, and celery salt; mix thoroughly. Dredge the brisket in this spice mixture making sure every part of it is well covered. Place in a deep dish covered with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 1 or 2 days. Heat 2 tablespoons of the corn oil in a large skillet, and brown the meat on both sides. Transfer brisket to a Dutch oven, add 1/2 cup water, cover, and simmer for 1 hour.",
        "While meat is simmering, heat remaining 2 tablespoons corn oil in a large skillet, and saut\u00e9 onions, stirring occasionally. When the onions are nicely browned, add garlic, which browns quickly. Add onions and garlic to brisket pot. Cover, and continue simmering for 2 1/2 hours, or until meat is fully cooked. To test for doneness, stick a fork in the leaner end of the brisket; when there is a slight pull on the fork as it is removed from the meat, it is done. Cook longer if necessary.Remove brisket to a plate, and trim all visible fat. Then place the brisket (with what was the fat side down) on a cutting board, and carve thin slices across the grain (the muscle lines of the brisket) with a sharp, thin-bladed knife. Serve hot with gravy from the pot or cold in sandwiches."
